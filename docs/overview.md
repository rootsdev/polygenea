Polygenea is designed to be a simple and versatile data model
for all kinds of family history research.
Its goals include

*	Representing the core atomic elements of genealogical research

*	Allowing disagreements and alternate views without conflict

*	Being able to represent all of the semantic nuances of all existing models

*	Simplicity: the spec should be as small and simple as possible

1.	[Guiding Principles](principles.md)

2.	[The 8 Node Types](nodes.md)

3.	[Serialization](serialization.md)

4.	[Use Cases](usecases.md), initially including
	
	* 	Changing data
	* 	Distributed research
	* 	Privacy and Data Ownership
	* 	Handling Disagreement
	* 	Handling Uncertainty
	* 	Recording Source Provenance
	* 	Attribution
	* 	Safe, Small, Interesting Tasks
	* 	Interactive Rule Creation

The reference Java and D implementations currently available
use reflection and meta-programming (which makes the hard to read)
and reflect a slightly older, more complicated version of Polygenea.
Updated reference implementations are in the works.
