polygenea
=========

An effort to document a data model for collaborative genealogy.

See [the wiki](https://github.com/rootsdev/polygenea/wiki) for more.

Most pages on the wiki now represent the current state of my design.
Missing pages will be added (hopefully soon).

Some other reference material can be found in [this slide deck](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/tychonievich/blog/media/DEV1349_Tychonievich_slides.pdf) from RootsTech 2014 and [CFPS 4](http://fhiso.org/files/cfp/cfps4.pdf) from FHISO's call for papers.
FHISO's [call for papers](http://fhiso.org/call-for-papers-submissions/) has several other related papers too.
