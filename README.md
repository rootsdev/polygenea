polygenea
=========

An effort to document a data model for collaborative genealogy.

Early work was summarized on [the wiki](https://github.com/rootsdev/polygenea/wiki).
That material no longer reflects the current status of the project, which is in the java prototype implemenation.
As the prototype converges the wiki will be updated to reflect that.

Some other reference material can be found in [this slide deck](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/tychonievich/blog/media/DEV1349_Tychonievich_slides.pdf) from RootsTech 2014 and [CFPS 4](http://fhiso.org/files/cfp/cfps4.pdf) from FHISO's call for papers.
FHISO's [call for papers](http://fhiso.org/call-for-papers-submissions/) has several other related papers too.
