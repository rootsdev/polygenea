/**
 * Each Thing node represents the claim a source might make that
 * "something exists". These are almost always implicit, as most sources begin
 * with descriptions of the characteristics of extant entities, not with
 * explicit assertions that things exist. For example, the text "John's brother"
 * asserts the existence of two things: one has the property "name:John" and
 * both are connected by a "brother" connection.
 * <p>
 * Each Thing has identity and a source, but, by the principle of sensible
 * disbelief, nothing else. We do not even store what type of thing it is
 * internally since it is quite possible in some sources to mistake a pet for a
 * person or the like.
