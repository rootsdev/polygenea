/**
 * A Grouping embodies undirected relationships between two or more other
 * claims. Groupings are often introduced via “<em>(list of subjects)</em> are
 * <em>relationship</em>” or “<em>relationship</em>
 * <em>(list of subjects)</em>”. Directed relationships should be represented
 * using Connection instead. If the group itself may have properties, the group
 * should be a Thing and membership in it a Connection between each member and
 * the group.
 * <p>
 * One Grouping relationship types deserve special note: "same", as in
 * "this node and that node both represent the same real-world thing." Because
 * of its semantic importance throughout Polygenea, the "same" relationship
 * applied to Thing nodes is handled by its own class (Match) instead of by
 * Grouping. Grouping nodes do handle other "same" claims (between Property or
 * Connection nodes) as well as related ideas such as of "distinct".
 * <p>
 * At some point a set of standardised relation fields will be produced. Even
 * once they are, though, custom relations will be permitted.
